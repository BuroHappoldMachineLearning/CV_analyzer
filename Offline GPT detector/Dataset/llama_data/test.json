However, existing works are unable to support database queries, such as “List/Count all female athletes who were born in 20th century”, which require reasoning over sets of relevant facts with operations such as join, filtering and aggregation. We show that while state-of-the-art transformer models perform very well for small databases, they exhibit limitations in processing noisy data, numerical operations, and queries that aggregate facts. We propose a modular architecture to answer these database-style queries over multiple spans from text and aggregating these at scale. We evaluate the architecture using WikiNLDB, a novel dataset for exploring such queries. Our architecture scales to databases containing thousands of facts whereas contemporary models are limited by how many facts can be encoded. In direct comparison on small databases, our approach increases overall answer accuracy from 85% to 90%. On larger databases, our approach retains its accuracy whereas transformer baselines could not encode the context.",

In contrast to categorical schema, our free-text dimensions provide a more nuanced way of understanding intent beyond being benign or malicious. We also introduce a Misinfo Reaction Frames corpus, a crowdsourced dataset of reactions to over 25k news headlines focusing on global crises: the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and cancer. Empirical results confirm that it is indeed possible for neural models to predict the prominent patterns of readers' reactions to previously unseen news headlines. Additionally, our user study shows that displaying machine-generated MRF implications alongside news headlines to readers can increase their trust in real news while decreasing their trust in misinformation.

Existing attempts on BT share a common characteristic: they employ either beam search or random sampling to generate synthetic data with a backward model but seldom work studies the role of synthetic data in the performance of BT. This motivates us to ask a fundamental question: what kind of synthetic data contributes to BT performance?Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we identify two key factors on synthetic data controlling the back-translation NMT performance, which are quality and importance. Furthermore, based on our findings, we propose a simple yet effective method to generate synthetic data to better trade off both factors so as to yield the better performance for BT. We run extensive experiments on WMT14 DE-EN, EN-DE, and RU-EN benchmark tasks. By employing our proposed method to generate synthetic data, our BT model significantly outperforms the standard BT baselines (i.e., beam and sampling based methods for data generation), which proves the effectiveness of our proposed methods.",

Experiments conducted on English-German and Chinese-English translation tasks show that the SAT achieves a good balance between translation quality and decoding speed. On WMT'14 English-German translation, the SAT achieves 5.58C-C-C speedup while maintaining 88% translation quality, significantly better than the previous non-autoregressive methods.

Second, the extraction is entirely data-driven, and there is no need to explicitly define the schemas. As far as we know, there has been no previous work that studies the problem. In this work, we formalize text-to-table as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problem. We first employ a seq2seq model fine-tuned from a pre-trained language model to perform the task.

        "text": "Neural sequence-to-sequence networks with attention have achieved remarkable performance for machine translation. One of the reasons for their effectiveness is their ability to capture relevant source-side contextual information at each time-step prediction through an attention mechanism. However, the target-side context is solely based on the sequence model which, in practice, is prone to a recency bias and lacks the ability to capture effectively non-sequential dependencies among words. To address this limitation, we propose a target-side-attentive residual recurrent network for decoding, where attention over previous words contributes directly to the prediction of the next word. The residual learning facilitates the flow of information from the distant past and is able to emphasize any of the previously translated words, hence it gains access to a wider context. The proposed model outperforms a neural MT baseline as well as a memory and self-attention network on three language pairs. The analysis of the attention learned by the decoder confirms that it emphasizes a wider context, and that it captures syntactic-like structures.",

They initialize the deep classifier by training over labeled texts; and then alternatively predict unlabeled texts as their pseudo-labels and train the deep classifier over the mixture of labeled and pseudo-labeled texts. Naturally, their performance is largely affected by the accuracy of pseudo-labels for unlabeled texts. Unfortunately, they often suffer from low accuracy because of the margin bias problem caused by the large difference between representation distributions of labels in SSTC. To alleviate this problem, we apply the angular margin loss, and perform Gaussian linear transformation to achieve balanced label angle variances, i.e., the variance of label angles of texts within the same label. More accuracy of predicted pseudo-labels can be achieved by constraining all label angle variances balanced, where they are estimated over both labeled and pseudo-labeled texts during self-training loops. With this insight, we propose a novel SSTC method, namely Semi-Supervised Text Classification with Balanced Deep representation Distributions (S2TC-BDD).

I understand that you're interested in learning more about domain-specific document retrieval and the challenges associated with it.\nTo clarify, domain-specific document retrieval refers to the task of searching for documents within a specific domain, such as medical or legal documents, based on their relevance to a particular query. This can be a challenging task because domain-specific documents often use terminologies and specialized knowledge that are not commonly found in other domains.\nPrevious approaches to addressing this challenge have involved adapting and transferring knowledge from other domains, but these methods still rely on the same document representation method, which can limit their effectiveness.\nOur proposed method, VKGDR, represents a given corpus as a graph of entities and their relations, known as a virtual knowledge graph, and computes the relevance between queries and documents based on the graph representation. This approach has shown promising results in three experiments we conducted:\n1. Domain-specific document retrieval: We evaluated VKGDR's performance in retrieving documents from a specific domain, and found that it outperformed baselines in a zero-shot setting and even outperformed fully-supervised bi-encoder.\n2. Comparison of virtual knowledge graph construction methods: We compared our virtual knowledge graph construction method with previous approaches, and found that our method resulted in better retrieval performance.\n3. Ablation study on component of virtual knowledge graph: We conducted an ablation study to analyze the effectiveness of each component of the virtual knowledge graph, and found that the graph representation improved the retrieval performance.\nOverall, our results suggest that unsupervised VKGDR can effectively improve domain-specific document retrieval performance, and our virtual knowledge graph construction method results in better retrieval performance than previous approaches.

To our best knowledge, we are the first to apply string kernels to automatically score essays. We are also the first to combine them with a high-level semantic feature representation, namely the bag-of-super-word-embeddings.

By carefully designing experiments on three language pairs, we find that Seq2Seq pretraining is a double-edged sword: On one hand, it helps NMT models to produce more diverse translations and reduce adequacy-related translation errors. On the other hand, the discrepancies between Seq2Seq pretraining and NMT finetuning limit the translation quality (i.e., domain discrepancy) and induce the over-estimation issue (i.e., objective discrepancy).

The clustering task and the target task are jointly trained and optimized to benefit each other, resulting in significant improvement in effectiveness. Additionally, our method groups words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves efficiency. We evaluate our method on several benchmark tasks, including machine translation, text classification, natural language inference, and text matching. Experimental results show that our method outperforms two typical sparse attention methods, Reformer and Routing Transformer while having a comparable or even better time and memory efficiency.",

Is this section edited as frequently as the other sections of a page? Can there be appropriate surrogates that can automatically enhance the reference section? In this paper, we propose a novel two step approach – WikiRef – that (i) leverages the wikilinks present in a scientific Wikipedia target page and, thereby, (ii) recommends highly relevant references to be included in that target page appropriately and automatically borrowed from the reference section of the wikilinks. In the first step, we build a classifier to ascertain whether a wikilink is a potential source of reference or not. In the following step, we recommend references to the target page from the reference section of the wikilinks that are classified as potential sources of references in the first step. We perform an extensive evaluation of our approach on datasets from two different domains – Computer Science and Physics. For Computer Science we achieve a notably good performance with a precision@1 of 0.44 for reference recommendation as opposed to 0.38 obtained from the most competitive baseline. For the Physics dataset, we obtain a similar performance boost of 10% with respect to the most competitive baseline.",

However, these methods often suffer from exponential increase in dimensions and in computational complexity introduced by transformation of input into tensor. In this paper, we propose the Low-rank Multimodal Fusion method, which performs multimodal fusion using low-rank tensors to improve efficiency. We evaluate our model on three different tasks: multimodal sentiment analysis, speaker trait analysis, and emotion recognition.

I understand that you're interested in learning more about multimodal research in artificial intelligence and the challenges associated with multimodal fusion.\nTo begin with, multimodal research is an interdisciplinary field that combines techniques from computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning to analyze and interpret multiple modalities of data. In the context of artificial intelligence, multimodal fusion refers to the process of combining multiple unimodal representations, such as images, text, and audio, into a single, more informative representation.\nThe main challenge in multimodal fusion is dealing with the exponential increase in dimensions and computational complexity that arises when transforming input data into a tensor representation. This is where our proposed method, Low-rank Multimodal Fusion, comes in.\nOur method leverages low-rank tensors to perform multimodal fusion in a more efficient manner. By exploiting the expressiveness of low-rank tensors, we can reduce the dimensionality of the input data while preserving the most important information. This results in a more robust and efficient model that can be trained and deployed more quickly.\nWe evaluate our method on three different tasks: multimodal sentiment analysis, speaker trait analysis, and emotion recognition. Our results show that our model achieves competitive performance on all three tasks while significantly reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can perform robustly across a wide range of low-rank settings, making it a more versatile and reliable choice for multimodal fusion tasks.\nI hope this helps clarify the challenges and opportunities in multimodal research and the proposed solution presented in the paper.

This iterative process of gathering user questions, annotating them, and retraining the model with the increased data set led to a corpus that now contains 12,883 user questions divided over 181 answers. We provide the first publicly available Dutch FAQ answering data set of this size with large groups of semantically equivalent human-paraphrased questions.

Additional pre-training with in-domain texts is the most common approach for providing domain-specific knowledge to PLMs. However, these pre-training methods require considerable in-domain data and training resources and a longer training time. Moreover, the training must be re-performed whenever a new PLM emerges. In this study, we propose a domain knowledge transferring (DoKTra) framework for PLMs without additional in-domain pretraining. Specifically, we extract the domain knowledge from an existing in-domain pretrained language model and transfer it to other PLMs by applying knowledge distillation. In particular, we employ activation boundary distillation, which focuses on the activation of hidden neurons. We also apply an entropy regularization term in both teacher training and distillation to encourage the model to generate reliable output probabilities, and thus aid the distillation. By applying the proposed DoKTra framework to downstream tasks in the biomedical, clinical, and financial domains, our student models can retain a high percentage of teacher performance and even outperform the teachers in certain tasks.

        "text": "Since the development and widespread adoption of pre-trained language models (PLMs), various methods have been employed to enhance their performance on downstream tasks in specific domains, such as biomedical or scientific domains. The most common approach involves additional in-domain pre-training to provide domain-specific knowledge to PLMs. However, this approach requires a substantial amount of in-domain data and training resources, as well as a longer training time. Furthermore, the training process must be repeated whenever a new PLM is introduced. In this study, we propose a domain knowledge transferring (DoKTra) framework for PLMs without requiring additional in-domain pretraining. Specifically, we extract the domain knowledge from an existing in-domain pre-trained language model and transfer it to other PLMs through knowledge distillation. We employ activation boundary distillation, which focuses on the activation of hidden neurons, and apply an entropy regularization term in both teacher training and distillation to encourage the model to generate reliable output probabilities. By applying the proposed DoKTra framework to downstream tasks in the biomedical, clinical, and financial domains, our student models can retain a significant percentage of the teacher's performance and even outperform the teacher in certain tasks. Our code is available at <https://github.com/DMCB-GIST/DoKTra>.",

To achieve this, we expand the contextual decomposition technique (Murdoch et al., 2018) to work with convolutional neural networks, allowing for a comparison between convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory networks. We evaluate and compare these models on the task of morphological tagging in three morphologically distinct languages and find that these models implicitely discover meaningful linguistic rules.",

Most of the previous work in this area have focused only on binary RSI, i.e., inducing only the subject and object type signatures per relation. However, in practice, many relations are high-order, i.e., they have more than two arguments and inducing type signatures of all arguments is necessary. For example, in the sports domain, inducing a schema win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer, Tournament, Location) is more informative than inducing just win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer). We refer to this problem as Higher-order Relation Schema Induction (HRSI). In this paper, we propose Tensor Factorization with Back-off and Aggregation (TFBA), a novel framework for the HRSI problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at inducing higher-order relation schemata from unlabeled text.

        "text": "Relation Schema Induction (RSI) is the problem of identifying type signatures of arguments of relations from unlabeled text. Most previous work in this area has focused solely on binary RSI, i.e., inducing only the subject and object type signatures per relation. However, in practice, many relations are high-order, i.e., they have more than two arguments, and inducing type signatures of all arguments is necessary. For example, in the sports domain, inducing a schema win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer, Tournament, Location) is more informative than inducing just win(WinningPlayer, OpponentPlayer). We refer to this problem as Higher-order Relation Schema Induction (HRSI). In this paper, we propose Tensor Factorization with Back-off and Aggregation (TFBA), a novel framework for the HRSI problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at inducing higher-order relation schemata from unlabeled text. Using the experimental analysis on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate how TFBA helps in dealing with sparsity and induces higher-order schemata.",

In speech recognition and translation tasks, existing methods often wait for a fixed duration before translating the input. However, this can lead to breaking up the acoustic units in speech, as the boundaries between them are not always uniform. To address this challenge, we propose MoSST, a simple yet effective method that translates streaming speech content in real-time. (Polished)\n3. The boundaries between acoustic units in speech are not always even, which can make it difficult to find the proper moments to generate partial sentence translations.

In this regard, this paper proposes a new heterogeneous graph neural network (HeterGNN) model to improve the performance of long document summarization (HeterGraphLongSum). Specifically, the main idea is to add the passage nodes into the heterogeneous graph structure of word and sentence nodes for enriching the final representation of sentences. In this regard, HeterGraphLongSum is designed with three types of semantic units such as word, sentence, and passage. Experiments on two benchmark datasets for long documents such as Pubmed and Arxiv indicate promising results of the proposed model for the extractive long document summarization problem. Especially, HeterGraphLongSum is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance without relying on any pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT).

To solve this problem, we novelly propose a hierarchical interactive network (HI-ASA) to model two-way interactions between two tasks appropriately, where the hierarchical interactions involve two steps: shallow-level interaction and deep-level interaction. First, we utilize cross-stitch mechanism to combine the different task-specific features selectively as the input to ensure proper two-way interactions. Second, the mutual information technique is applied to mutually constrain learning between two tasks in the output layer, thus the aspect input and the sentiment input are capable of encoding features of the other task via backpropagation.

Both of them ignore the internal correlations between the aspect extraction and sentiment classification.\nTo solve this problem, we novelly propose a hierarchical interactive network (HI-ASA) to model two-way interactions between two tasks appropriately, where the hierarchical interactions involve two steps: shallow-level interaction and deep-level interaction. First, we utilize cross-stitch mechanism to combine the different task-specific features selectively as the input to ensure proper two-way interactions. Second, the mutual information technique is applied to mutually constrain learning between two tasks in the output layer, thus the aspect input and the sentiment input are capable of encoding features of the other task via backpropagation.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate HI-ASA's superiority over baselines.",

By dialogue-based explanation of an event, we mean explaining it through a consistent and information-intensive dialogue, with the original event description as the start utterance. We propose three simple dialogue generation methods, whose outputs are then fed into a hybrid attention mechanism to characterize the complementary event semantics. Extensive experimental results on two event detection datasets verify the effectiveness of our method and suggest promising research opportunities in the dialogue-based explanation paradigm.",

Our method fully utilizes the knowledge learned from CLIP to build an in-domain dataset by self-exploration without human labeling. Unlike the conventional approach of fine-tuning, we introduce prompt tuning to achieve fast adaptation for language embeddings, which substantially improves the learning efficiency by leveraging prior knowledge.

In this paper, we show that the modeling problem can be solved by standard sequence-to-sequence architectures of sufficient depth, and that deep models operating at the character level outperform identical models operating over word fragments. This result implies that alternative architectures for handling character input are better viewed as methods for reducing computation time than as improved ways of modeling longer sequences. From this perspective, we evaluate several techniques for character-level NMT, verify that they do not match the performance of our deep character baseline model, and evaluate the performance versus computation time tradeoffs they offer.

In general, there are two strategies to track a dialogue state: predicting it from scratch and updating it from previous state. The scratch-based strategy obtains each slot value by inquiring all the dialogue history, and the previous-based strategy relies on the current turn dialogue to update the previous dialogue state. However, it is hard for the scratch-based strategy to correctly track short-dependency dialogue state because of noise; meanwhile, the previous-based strategy is not very useful for long-dependency dialogue state tracking. Obviously, it plays different roles for the context information of different granularity to track different kinds of dialogue states. Thus, in this paper, we will study and discuss how the context information of different granularity affects dialogue state tracking. First, we explore how greatly different granularities affect dialogue state tracking. Then, we further discuss how to combine multiple granularities for dialogue state tracking. Finally, we apply the findings about context granularity to few-shot learning scenario. Besides, we have publicly released all codes.",

Given a claim, existing works focus on providing evidence for detection by reranking candidate fact-checking articles (FC-articles) retrieved by BM25. However, these performances may be limited because they ignore the following characteristics of FC-articles: (1) claims are often quoted to describe the checked events, providing lexical information besides semantics; (2) sentence templates to introduce or debunk claims are common across articles, providing pattern information. Models that ignore the two aspects only leverage semantic relevance and may be misled by sentences that describe similar but irrelevant events. In this paper, we propose a novel reranker, MTM (Memory-enhanced Transformers for Matching) to rank FC-articles using key sentences selected with event (lexical and semantic) and pattern information. For event information, we propose a ROUGE-guided Transformer which is finetuned with regression of ROUGE. For pattern information, we generate pattern vectors for matching with sentences. By fusing event and pattern information, we select key sentences to represent an article and then predict if the article fact-checks the given claim using the claim, key sentences, and patterns. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MTM outperforms existing methods. Human evaluation proves that MTM can capture key sentences for explanations.",

Hence, we examine the effect of a human-like easy-to-difficult curriculum during finetuning of language models for commonsense reasoning tasks. We use paced curriculum learning to rank data and sample training mini-batches with increasing levels of difficulty from the ranked dataset during finetuning. Further, we investigate the effect of an adaptive curriculum, i.e., the data ranking is dynamically updated during training based on the current state of the learner model. We use a teacher model to measure difficulty of each sample and experiment with three measures based on question answering probability, variability and out-of-distribution.

Our context-aware neural machine translation model is designed to address this issue by controlling the flow of information from the extended context to the translation model.\n2. We experiment with an English-Russian subtitles dataset, and find that the model improves pronoun translation significantly. Analyzing the induced attention distributions and coreference relations, we discover that the model implicitly captures anaphora, leading to better translations in gendered pronoun cases.\n3. The model's improvements in anaphoric cases are not limited to pronouns, but also result in overall BLEU scores rising by 0.7 and 0.6 when compared to a context-agnostic version and simple concatenation of the context and source sentences, respectively.\nRemember, the assistant is polite and helpful, and is always willing to clarify or provide more information when needed.",

By analyzing multimodal data, our model can accurately classify whether an utterance is humorous or not, and quantify its intensity. We utilize the prerecorded laughter in the show as annotation, as it signals humor and duration of the audience's laughter provides an indication of the joke's humor. Our evaluation on unseen episodes demonstrates that our model can correctly identify humorous utterances 78% of the time and estimate the audience's laughter duration with a mean absolute error of 600 milliseconds.\nI hope this helps!

Yet, human annotators usually use a small number of sentences to identify the relationship between a given entity pair. In this paper, we present an embarrassingly simple but effective method to heuristically select evidence sentences for document-level RE, which can be easily combined with BiLSTM to achieve good performance on benchmark datasets, even better than fancy graph neural network based methods. We have released our code at <https://github.com/AndrewZhe/Three-Sentences-Are-All-You-Need>.\nPolishing sentences can make them more clear, concise, and easier to understand. Here's how I can help:\n1. Simplifying complex sentences: I can break down long, convoluted sentences into simpler ones that are easier to comprehend.\n2. Improving sentence structure: I can reorganize sentences to make them more logical and coherent, with proper verb tense and subject-verb agreement.\n3. Removing redundancy: I can identify and eliminate redundant words or phrases that don't add any value to the sentence.\n4. Enhancing readability: I can make sentences more pleasant to read by using active voice, varying sentence length, and incorporating transitional phrases.\n5. Making the tone more appropriate: I can adjust the tone of the sentences to match the context and audience, making them more formal or informal as needed.\nBy polishing sentences, you can improve their overall quality and make them more effective in conveying your message.",

Existing methods usually encode the entire hierarchical structure and fail to construct a robust label-dependent model, making it hard to make accurate predictions on sparse lower-level labels and achieving low Macro-F1. In this paper, we explore the level dependency and path dependency of the label hierarchy in a generative way for building the knowledge of upper-level labels of current path into lower-level ones, and thus propose a novel PAAM-HiA-T5 model for HTC: a hierarchy-aware T5 model with path-adaptive attention mechanism. Specifically, we generate a multi-level sequential label structure to exploit hierarchical dependency across different levels with Breadth-First Search (BFS) and T5 model. To further improve label dependency prediction within each path, we then propose an original path-adaptive attention mechanism (PAAM) to lead the model to adaptively focus on the path where the currently generated label is located, shielding the noise from other paths.

        "text": "Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC), which aims to predict text labels organized in hierarchical space, is a significant task lacking in investigation in natural language processing. Existing methods usually encode the entire hierarchical structure and fail to construct a robust label-dependent model, making it hard to make accurate predictions on sparse lower-level labels and achieving low Macro-F1. In this paper, we explore the level dependency and path dependency of the label hierarchy in a generative way for building the knowledge of upper-level labels of current path into lower-level ones, and thus propose a novel PAAM-HiA-T5 model for HTC: a hierarchy-aware T5 model with path-adaptive attention mechanism. Specifically, we generate a multi-level sequential label structure to exploit hierarchical dependency across different levels with Breadth-First Search (BFS) and T5 model. To further improve label dependency prediction within each path, we then propose an original path-adaptive attention mechanism (PAAM) to lead the model to adaptively focus on the path where the currently generated label is located, shielding the noise from other paths. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that PAAM-HiA-T5 greatly outperforms all state-of-the-art HTC approaches especially in Macro-F1.",

This paper proposes a sentence-level DSRE method beyond typical instance selection approaches by preventing samples from falling into the wrong classification space on the feature space. Specifically, a theorem for denoising and the corresponding implementation, named Consensus Enhanced Training Approach (CETA), are proposed in this paper. By training the model with CETA, samples of different classes are separated, and samples of the same class are closely clustered in the feature space. Thus the model can easily establish the robust classification boundary to prevent noisy labels from biasing wrongly labeled samples into the wrong classification space. This process is achieved by enhancing the classification consensus between two discrepant classifiers and does not depend on any potential noisy labels, thus avoiding the above two limitations. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks have demonstrated that CETA significantly outperforms the previous methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results.",

However, there has been relatively less work on analyzing their ability to generate structured outputs such as graphs. Unlike natural language, graphs have distinct structural and semantic properties in the context of a downstream NLP task, e.g., generating a graph that is connected and acyclic can be attributed to its structural constraints, while the semantics of a graph can refer to how meaningfully an edge represents the relation between two node concepts. In this work, we study pre-trained language models that generate explanation graphs in an end-to-end manner and analyze their ability to learn the structural constraints and semantics of such graphs. We first show that with limited supervision, pre-trained language models often generate graphs that either violate these constraints or are semantically incoherent. Since curating large amount of human-annotated graphs is expensive and tedious, we propose simple yet effective ways of graph perturbations via node and edge edit operations that lead to structurally and semantically positive and negative graphs. Next, we leverage these graphs in different contrastive learning models with Max-Margin and InfoNCE losses.

        "text": "Pre-trained sequence-to-sequence language models have demonstrated remarkable success in various natural language generation tasks. However, there has been relatively less research on their ability to generate structured outputs, such as graphs, which have distinct structural and semantic properties in the context of downstream NLP tasks. Unlike natural language, graphs have intrinsic structural and semantic constraints, such as being connected and acyclic, which can be attributed to their structural properties, while the semantics of a graph refer to how meaningfully an edge represents the relation between two node concepts. In this work, we investigate pre-trained language models that generate explanation graphs in an end-to-end manner and analyze their ability to learn the structural constraints and semantics of such graphs. We first reveal that with limited supervision, pre-trained language models often generate graphs that either violate these constraints or are semantically incoherent. Since annotating large amounts of human-annotated graphs is expensive and time-consuming, we propose simple yet effective methods for graph perturbations through node and edge editing operations that lead to structurally and semantically positive and negative graphs. Next, we leverage these graphs in different contrastive learning models with Max-Margin and InfoNCE losses. Our approaches lead to significant improvements in both structural and semantic accuracy of explanation graphs and also generalize to other similar graph generation tasks. Finally, we show that human errors are the best negatives for contrastive learning, and also that automatically generating more such human-like negative graphs can lead to further improvements.",

We show that pre-trained language models suffer from overgeneralization and tend to treat quantified generic statements such as “all ducks lay eggs” as if they were true generics. Furthermore, we demonstrate how knowledge embedding methods can lessen this effect by injecting factual knowledge about kinds into pre-trained language models. To this end, we source factual knowledge about two types of generics, minority characteristic generics and majority characteristic generics, and inject this knowledge using a knowledge embedding model. Our results show that knowledge injection reduces, but does not eliminate, generic overgeneralization, and that majority characteristic generics of kinds are more susceptible to overgeneralization bias.",

It's important to recognize that generic statements, such as \"ducks lay eggs,\" can be overly broad and may not accurately reflect the diversity within a particular category. The generic overgeneralization effect refers to the tendency to accept false universal generalizations, such as \"all ducks lay eggs,\" as true.\nIn our research, we investigate the generic overgeneralization effect in pre-trained language models through experimental means. We find that pre-trained language models tend to overgeneralize when encountering quantified generic statements, such as \"all ducks lay eggs,\" and treat them as true generics.\nTo address this issue, we explore the use of knowledge embedding methods to inject factual knowledge about kinds into pre-trained language models. We source this knowledge from various sources, including minority characteristic generics and majority characteristic generics, and use a knowledge embedding model to inject it into the language models.\nOur results show that knowledge injection reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the generic overgeneralization effect. Additionally, we find that majority characteristic generics of kinds are more susceptible to overgeneralization bias.\nI hope this helps clarify the issue of generic overgeneralization and how it can be addressed through knowledge embedding methods!

However, these models tend to rely on spurious correlations between prediction labels and input features, which in general suffer from robustness and generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel Spurious Correlation reduction method to improve the robustness of the neural ANswer selection models (SCAN) from the sample and feature perspectives by removing the feature dependencies and language biases in answer selection. First, from the sample perspective, we propose a feature decorrelation module by learning a weight for each instance at the training phase to remove the feature dependencies and reduce the spurious correlations without prior knowledge of such correlations. Second, from the feature perspective, we propose a feature debiasing module with contrastive learning to alleviate the negative language biases (spurious correlations) and further improve the robustness of the AS models. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that SCAN achieves substantial improvements over strong baselines. For reproducibility, we will release our code and data upon the publication of this paper.",

In this paper, we revisit the classical methods and propose a new few-shot alternative. Specifically, we investigate the few-shot one-class problem, which actually takes a known sample as a reference to detect whether an unknown instance belongs to the same class. This problem can be studied from the perspective of sequence match. It is shown that with meta-learning, the classical sequence match method, i.e. Compare-Aggregate, significantly outperforms transformer ones. The classical approach requires much less training cost. Furthermore, we perform an empirical comparison between two kinds of sequence match approaches under simple fine-tuning and meta-learning. Meta-learning causes the transformer models' features to have high-correlation dimensions. The reason is closely related to the number of layers and heads of transformer models.

Parsing these using beam search yields a variety of incremental complexity metrics, such as word surprisal and parser action count. When used as regressors against human electrophysiological responses to naturalistic text, they derive two amplitude effects: an early peak and a P600-like later peak. By contrast, a non-syntactic neural language model yields no reliable effects. Model comparisons attribute the early peak to syntactic composition within the RNNG. This pattern of results recommends the RNNG+beam search combination as a mechanistic model of the syntactic processing that occurs during normal human language comprehension.",

We resolve the imperfections of the ELS by (a) encoding entities with selective disambiguation, and (b) pooling entity vectors using firm attention.

In this study, we conduct a thorough investigation to uncover the underlying predictive mechanisms of MLMs across different extraction paradigms. By examining the behavior of MLMs, we discover that their previous decent performance primarily owes to the biased prompts, which overfit dataset artifacts. Additionally, incorporating illustrative cases and external contexts improve knowledge prediction mainly due to entity type guidance and golden answer leakage. Our findings provide insight into the predictive mechanisms of MLMs and challenge the previous conclusion that current MLMs can serve as reliable factual knowledge bases.",

We present a large-scale empirical study of the features and limits of LM adaptability using a new benchmark, TaskBench500, built from 500 procedurally generated sequence modeling tasks. These tasks combine core aspects of language processing, including lexical semantics, sequence processing, memorization, logical reasoning, and world knowledge. Using TaskBench500, we evaluate three facets of adaptability, finding that: (1) adaptation procedures differ dramatically in their ability to memorize small datasets; (2) within a subset of task types, adaptation procedures exhibit compositional adaptability to complex tasks; and (3) failure to match training label distributions is explained by mismatches in the intrinsic difficulty of predicting individual labels.

We study how to improve a black box model's performance on a new domain by leveraging explanations of the model's behavior. Our approach first extracts a set of features combining human intuition about the task with model attributions generated by black box interpretation techniques, then uses a simple calibrator, in the form of a classifier, to predict whether the base model was correct or not. We experiment with our method on two tasks, extractive question answering and natural language inference, covering adaptation from several pairs of domains with limited target-domain data.

        "text": "Maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) is one of the most widely used approaches for training structured prediction models for text-generation based natural language processing applications. However, models trained with MLE suffer from wrong objective problems, where they are trained to maximize the word-level correct next step prediction, but are evaluated with respect to sequence-level discrete metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU. Several variants of policy-gradient methods address some of these problems by optimizing for final discrete evaluation metrics and showing improvements over MLE training for downstream tasks like text summarization and machine translation. However, policy-gradient methods suffer from high sample variance, making the training process very difficult and unstable. In this paper, we present an alternative direction towards mitigating this problem by introducing a new objective (CaLcs) based on a differentiable surrogate of the longest common subsequence (LCS) measure that captures sequence-level structure similarity. Experimental results on abstractive summarization and machine translation validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

In this work, we argue that current FMS methods are vulnerable, as the assessment mainly relies on the static features extracted from PTMs. However, such features are derived without training PTMs on downstream tasks, and are not necessarily reliable indicators for the PTM's transferability. To validate our viewpoints, we design two methods to evaluate the robustness of FMS: (1) model disguise attack, which post-trains an inferior PTM with a contrastive objective, and (2) evaluation data selection, which selects a subset of the data points for FMS evaluation based on K-means clustering. Experimental results prove that both methods can successfully make FMS mistakenly judge the transferability of PTMs. Moreover, we find that these two methods can further be combined with the backdoor attack to misguide the FMS to select poisoned models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the defects of current FMS algorithms and evaluate their potential security risks. By identifying previously unseen risks of FMS, our study indicates new directions for improving the robustness of FMS.",

However, a standing limitation of these models is that they are trained against limited references and with plain maximum-likelihood objectives. As for many other generative tasks, reinforcement learning (RL) offers the potential to improve the training of MDS models; yet, it requires a carefully-designed reward that can ensure appropriate leverage of both the reference summaries and the input documents. For this reason, in this paper we propose fine-tuning an MDS baseline with a reward that balances a reference-based metric such as ROUGE with coverage of the input documents. To implement the approach, we utilize RELAX (Grathwohl et al., 2018), a contemporary gradient estimator which is both low-variance and unbiased, and we fine-tune the baseline in a few-shot style for both stability and computational efficiency. Experimental results over the Multi-News and WCEP MDS datasets show significant improvements of up to +0.95 pp average ROUGE score and +3.17 pp METEOR score over the baseline, and competitive results with the literature. In addition, they show that the coverage of the input documents is increased, and evenly across all documents.",

Some previous works have proved that storing typical samples of old relations in memory can help the model keep a stable understanding of old relations and avoid forgetting them.

In this position paper, we demonstrate how NLP can enhance the benefits of BPM practices at different levels. Instead of being exhaustive, we highlight select key challenges that could be automated through the application of NLP techniques, thereby reducing the effort required to accomplish them.

        "text": "Metaphor involves not only a linguistic phenomenon, but also a cognitive phenomenon structuring human thought, which makes understanding it challenging. As a means of cognition, metaphor is rendered by more than texts alone, and multimodal information in which vision/audio content is integrated with the text can play an important role in expressing and understanding metaphor. However, previous metaphor processing and understanding has focused on texts, partly due to the unavailability of large-scale datasets with ground truth labels of multimodal metaphor. In this paper, we introduce MultiMET, a novel multimodal metaphor dataset to facilitate understanding metaphorical information from multimodal text and image. It contains 10,437 text-image pairs from a range of sources with multimodal annotations of the occurrence of metaphors, domain relations, sentiments metaphors convey, and author intents. MultiMET opens the door to automatic metaphor understanding by investigating multimodal cues and their interplay. Moreover, we propose a range of strong baselines and show the importance of combining multimodal cues for metaphor understanding. MultiMET will be released publicly for research.",

        "text": "Thank you for sharing your question with me! I'm here to help you with your inquiry. The concept of metaphor is indeed a complex and multifaceted one, involving both linguistic and cognitive aspects. As you've mentioned, metaphor is not only limited to textual expressions, but can also be conveyed through visual and audio means, such as images and audio recordings.\n\nResearch on metaphor processing has historically focused on text-based datasets, which have limited the scope of understanding the full range of metaphorical expressions. However, with the introduction of large-scale multimodal datasets like MultiMET, it is now possible to investigate how metaphors are constructed and understood in a more comprehensive manner.\n\nMultiMET is an innovative dataset that offers a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between textual and visual/audio cues in metaphorical language. By providing annotations for various aspects of metaphorical meaning, including the occurrence of metaphors, domain relations, sentiments, and author intents, this dataset enables researchers to develop and evaluate sophisticated models for automatic metaphor understanding.\n\nI must say, the paper you mentioned is quite fascinating, and I'm glad to see that it highlights the importance of multimodal cues in metaphor comprehension. The proposed baselines and the emphasis on combining multiple cues are particularly noteworthy, as they demonstrate the potential for more accurate metaphor identification and interpretation.\n\nOverall, I believe that MultiMET will be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on metaphor understanding, and I'm excited to see the insights it will bring to the field.",

This paper proposes a new approach to dialogue state tracking, referred to as Seq2Seq-DU, which formalizes DST as a sequence-to-sequence problem. Seq2Seq-DU employs two BERT-based encoders to respectively encode the utterances in the dialogue and the descriptions of schemas, an attender to calculate attentions between the utterance embeddings and the schema embeddings, and a decoder to generate pointers to represent the current state of dialogue. Seq2Seq-DU has the following advantages. It can jointly model intents, slots, and slot values; it can leverage the rich representations of utterances and schemas based on BERT; it can effectively deal with categorical and non-categorical slots, and unseen schemas. In addition, Seq2Seq-DU can also be used in the NLU (natural language understanding) module of a dialogue system. Experimental results on benchmark datasets in different settings (SGD, MultiWOZ2.2, MultiWOZ2.1, WOZ2.0, DSTC2, M2M, SNIPS, and ATIS) show that Seq2Seq-DU outperforms the existing methods.",

Our corpus, QA-SRL Bank 2.0, encompasses over 250,000 question-answer pairs covering more than 64,000 sentences across three domains, and was gathered using a novel crowdsourcing approach that boasts high precision and good recall at a reasonable cost. Additionally, we present cutting-edge neural models for two QA-SRL subtasks: identifying argument spans for a predicate and generating questions to label the semantic relationship. Our best models achieve question accuracy of 82.6% and span-level accuracy of 77.6% (under human evaluation) on the complete pipelined QA-SRL prediction task. They can also, as we demonstrate, be used to generate additional annotations at a low cost.",

To better capture and incorporate the global semantic information into PLMs, the graph contrastive topic model integrates the hierarchical transformer encoder and the graph contrastive learning to fuse the semantic information from the global document context and the gold summary. To this end, GRETEL encourages the model to efficiently extract salient sentences that are topically related to the gold summary, rather than redundant sentences that cover sub-optimal topics.

        "text": "Recognizing lexical semantic relations between word pairs is a crucial task in natural language processing, with many applications. One common approach involves exploiting lexico-syntactic paths connecting the target words, which can reveal their semantic relationships. However, this method relies on co-occurrence in sentences, which can be challenging due to Zipf's law, which states that most content words appear infrequently. In this paper, we propose novel methods using a neural model of P(path|w1,w2) to address this issue. Our proposed model can learn the probability of a path between two words in an unsupervised manner and generalize the co-occurrences of word pairs and dependency paths. This allows us to augment the path data of word pairs that do not co-occur in the corpus and extract features capturing relational information from word pairs. Our experimental results show that our methods outperform previous neural approaches based on dependency paths and successfully solve the focused problem.",

In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of using the Transformer model to detect various types of annotator errors in morphological data sets that contain inflected word forms. We evaluate our error detection model on four languages by introducing three different types of artificial errors in the data: (1) typographic errors, where single characters in the data are inserted, replaced, or deleted; (2) linguistic confusion errors where two inflected forms are systematically swapped; and (3) self-adversarial errors where the Transformer model itself is used to generate plausible-looking, but erroneous forms by retrieving high-scoring predictions from the search beam. Results show that the Transformer model can with perfect, or near-perfect recall detect errors in all three scenarios, even when significant amounts of the annotated data (5%-30%) are corrupted on all languages tested. Precision varies across the languages and types of errors, but is high enough that the model can be very effectively used to flag suspicious entries in large data sets for further scrutiny by human annotators.",

Existing work mainly focuses on learning deep NER models only with weak supervision, i.e., without any human annotation, and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data, one can achieve good performance, though still underperforms fully supervised NER with manually/strongly labeled data. In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data and a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that weakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model performance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep NER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and weakly labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-stage computational framework – NEEDLE with three essential ingredients: (1) weak label completion, (2) noise-aware loss function, and (3) final fine-tuning over the strongly labeled data. Through experiments on E-commerce query NER and Biomedical NER, we demonstrate that NEEDLE can effectively suppress the noise of the weak labels and outperforms existing methods.

Training such dialogue systems often requires a vast dataset comprising multi-turn dialogues that involve images, but such datasets are rarely available. In response, this paper proposes a 45k multi-modal dialogue dataset, which was created with minimal human intervention. Our method for generating such a dataset involves the following steps:\n\n1. Preparing and pre-processing text dialogue datasets\n2. Creating image-mixed dialogues by employing a text-to-image replacement technique\n3. Employing a contextual-similarity-based filtering step to ensure the contextual coherence of the dataset\n\nTo evaluate the validity of our dataset, we designed a simple retrieval model for dialogue sentence prediction tasks. Automatic metrics and human evaluation results on such tasks demonstrate that our dataset can be effectively utilized as training data for multi-modal dialogue systems that require an understanding of both images and text in a context-aware manner.

As a result, RE still suffers from unintended entity bias, i.e., the spurious correlation between entity mentions (names) and relations. Entity bias can mislead the RE models to extract the relations that do not exist in the text. To combat this issue, some previous work masks the entity mentions to prevent the RE models from over-fitting entity mentions. However, this strategy degrades the RE performance because it loses the semantic information of entities. In this paper, we propose the CoRE (Counterfactual Analysis based Relation Extraction) debiasing method that guides the RE models to focus on the main effects of textual context without losing the entity information. We first construct a causal graph for RE, which models the dependencies between variables in RE models. Then, we propose to conduct counterfactual analysis on our causal graph to distill and mitigate the entity bias, that captures the causal effects of specific entity mentions in each instance. Note that our CoRE method is model-agnostic to debias existing RE systems during inference without changing their training processes.

        "text": "Pre-trained multilingual language models such as mBERT and XLM-R have demonstrated great potential for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to low web-resource languages (LRL). However, due to limited model capacity, the large difference in the sizes of available monolingual corpora between high web-resource languages (HRL) and LRLs does not provide enough scope of co-embedding the LRL with the HRL, thereby affecting the downstream task performance of LRLs. In this paper, we argue that relatedness among languages in a language family along the dimension of lexical overlap may be leveraged to overcome some of the corpora limitations of LRLs. We propose Overlap BPE (OBPE), a simple yet effective modification to the BPE vocabulary generation algorithm which enhances overlap across related languages. Through extensive experiments on multiple NLP tasks and datasets, we observe that OBPE generates a vocabulary that increases the representation of LRLs via tokens shared with HRLs. This results in improved zero-shot transfer from related HRLs to LRLs without reducing HRL representation and accuracy. Unlike previous studies that dismissed the importance of token-overlap, we show that in the low-resource related language setting, token overlap matters.

        "text": "Pre-trained multilingual language models, such as mBERT and XLM-R, have shown great potential for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to low web-resource languages (LRL). However, due to limited model capacity, the large difference in available monolingual corpora between high web-resource languages (HRL) and LRLs can hinder the co-embedding of LRLs with HRLs, thereby affecting the downstream task performance of LRLs. In this paper, we argue that relatedness among languages in a language family along the dimension of lexical overlap may be leveraged to overcome some of the corpus limitations of LRLs. We propose Overlap BPE (OBPE), a simple yet effective modification to the BPE vocabulary generation algorithm that enhances overlap across related languages. Through extensive experiments on multiple NLP tasks and datasets, we observe that OBPE generates a vocabulary that increases the representation of LRLs via tokens shared with HRLs.

For example, \"We release an evaluation scheme and dataset for measuring the ability of NMT models to translate gender morphology correctly in unambiguous contexts across syntactically diverse sentences. Our dataset translates from an English source into 20 languages from several different language families, providing a rich and diverse testing ground for NMT models to demonstrate their proficiency in gender morphology.\"\n5. Use active voice: In the last sentence, consider using active voice to make the sentence more engaging. For example, \"Our hope is that the NMT community can leverage this dataset to develop and refine models that can accurately translate gender morphology in unambiguous contexts across a wide range of languages.\"\nI hope these suggestions help you improve your sentences!

        "text": "Deep learning (DL) techniques involving fine-tuning large numbers of model parameters have delivered impressive performance on the task of discriminating between language produced by cognitively healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, questions remain about their ability to generalize beyond the small reference sets that are publicly available for research.\nAs an alternative to fitting model parameters directly, we propose a novel method by which a Transformer DL model (GPT-2) pre-trained on general English text is paired with an artificially degraded version of itself (GPT-D), to compute the ratio between these two models' perplexities on language from cognitively healthy and impaired individuals. This technique approaches state-of-the-art performance on text data from a widely used \"Cookie Theft\" picture description task, and unlike established alternatives also generalizes well to spontaneous conversations. Furthermore, GPT-D generates text with characteristics known to be associated with AD, demonstrating the induction of dementia-related linguistic anomalies. Our study represents a step toward better understanding the relationships between the inner workings of generative neural language models, the language that they produce, and the deleterious effects of dementia on human speech and language characteristics.",

Previous works have focused on classifying document-level text into fiction and non-fiction genres, while in this work, we deal with shorter texts which are closer to real-world applications like sentiment analysis of tweets. Going beyond simple POS tag ratios proposed in Qureshi et al.(2019) for document-level classification, we extracted multiple linguistically motivated features belonging to four categories: Lexical features, POS ratio features, Syntactic features and Raw features. For the task of short-text classification, a model containing 28 best-features (selected via Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation; RFECV) confers an accuracy jump of 15.56 % over a baseline model consisting of 2 POS-ratio features found effective in previous work (cited above). The efficacy of the above model containing a linguistically motivated feature set also transfers over to another dataset viz, Baby BNC corpus. We also compared the classification accuracy of the logistic regression model with two deep-learning models. A 1D CNN model gives an increase of 2% accuracy over the logistic Regression classifier on both corpora. And the BERT-base-uncased model gives the best classification accuracy of 97% on Brown corpus and 98% on Baby BNC corpus. Although both the deep learning models give better results in terms of classification accuracy, the problem of interpreting these models remains unsolved. In contrast, regression model coefficients revealed that fiction texts tend to have more character-level diversity and have lower lexical density (quantified using content-function word ratios) compared to non-fiction texts. Moreover, subtle differences in word order exist between the two genres, i.e., in fiction texts Verbs precede Adverbs (inter-alia).",

As such, they often complement distributional text-based information and facilitate various downstream tasks. Since their manual construction is resource- and time-intensive, recent efforts have tried leveraging large pretrained language models (PLMs) to generate additional monolingual knowledge facts for KBs. However, such methods have not been attempted for building and enriching multilingual KBs. Besides wider application, such multilingual KBs can provide richer combined knowledge than monolingual (e.g., English) KBs. Knowledge expressed in different languages may be complementary and unequally distributed: this implies that the knowledge available in high-resource languages can be transferred to low-resource ones. To achieve this, it is crucial to represent multilingual knowledge in a shared/unified space. To this end, we propose a unified representation model, Prix-LM, for multilingual KB construction and completion. We leverage two types of knowledge, monolingual triples and cross-lingual links, extracted from existing multilingual KBs, and tune a multilingual language encoder XLM-R via a causal language modeling objective. Prix-LM integrates useful multilingual and KB-based factual knowledge into a single model.

However, SLU corpora consist of plenty of semantic labels (slots), which general-purpose translators cannot handle well, not to mention additional culture differences. This paper focuses on the language transferring task given a small in-domain parallel SLU corpus. The in-domain parallel corpus can be used as the first adaptation on the general translator.

Our research demonstrates that, without any supervision and solely relying on unlabeled text, we can build a Natural Language Generation (NLG) system surpassing supervised approaches in performance. In our approach, we view the structured data as an imperfect representation of the desired output and utilize a denoising auto-encoder to generate coherent sentences. By introducing noise into training examples that lack structured data, we train a denoising auto-encoder that can generate accurate sentences when exposed to structured data. Our findings demonstrate the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in NLG applications.",

To address this issue, we propose ProQA, a unified QA paradigm that solves various tasks through a single model. ProQA takes a unified structural prompt as the bridge and improves the QA-centric ability by structural prompt-based pre-training. Through a structurally designed prompt-based input schema, ProQA concurrently models the knowledge generalization for all QA tasks while keeping the knowledge customization for every specific QA task. Additionally, ProQA is pre-trained with a large-scale synthesized corpus formatted into structural prompts, which empowers the model with the commonly required QA ability. Experimental results on 11 QA benchmarks demonstrate that ProQA consistently boosts performance on both full data fine-tuning, few-shot learning, and zero-shot testing scenarios. Furthermore, ProQA exhibits strong ability in both continual learning and transfer learning by leveraging the advantages of the structural prompt.",

Della learns a series of layer-wise latent variables with each inferred from those of lower layers and tightly coupled with the hidden states by low-rank tensor product. In this way, Della forces these posterior latent variables to be fused deeply with the whole computation path and hence incorporate more information. We theoretically demonstrate that our method can be regarded as entangling latent variables to avoid posterior information decrease through layers, enabling Della to get higher non-zero KL values even without any annealing or thresholding tricks.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel Multi-level Community-awareness Graph Neural Network (MC-GNN) layer to jointly model local and global relationships between words and their linguistic roles in multiple communities. Intuitively, the MC-GNN layer replaces the self-attention layer at the encoder side of a transformer-based machine translation model. Extensive experiments on four language pairs with common evaluation metrics demonstrate the remarkable improvements of our method while reducing the time complexity in very long sentences.",

The generated commonsense augments effective self-supervision to facilitate both high-quality negative sampling (NS) and joint commonsense and fact-view link prediction. Experimental results on the KGC task demonstrate that assembling our framework could enhance the performance of the original KGE models, and the proposed commonsense-aware NS module is superior to other NS techniques. Besides, our proposed framework could be easily adaptive to various KGE models and explain the predicted results.",

To address these issues, we introduce several discriminative attributes of charges as the internal mapping between fact descriptions and charges. These attributes provide additional information for few-shot charges, as well as effective signals for distinguishing confusing charges.

        "text": "Forcing the answer of the Question Answering (QA) task to be a single text span might be restrictive since the answer can be multiple spans in the context. Moreover, we found that multi-span answers often appear with two characteristics when building the QA system for a real-world application. First, multi-span answers might be caused by users lacking domain knowledge and asking ambiguous questions, which makes the question need to be answered with conditions. Second, there might be hierarchical relations among multiple answer spans. Some recent span-extraction QA datasets include multi-span samples, but they only contain unconditional and parallel answers, which cannot be used to tackle this problem. To bridge the gap, we propose a new task: conditional question answering with hierarchical multi-span answers, where both the hierarchical relations and the conditions need to be extracted. Correspondingly, we introduce CMQA, a Conditional Multiple-span Chinese Question Answering dataset to study the new proposed task. The final release of CMQA consists of 7,861 QA pairs and 113,089 labels, where all samples contain multi-span answers, 50.4% of samples are conditional, and 56.6% of samples are hierarchical. CMQA can serve as a benchmark to study the new proposed task and help study building QA systems for real-world applications. The low performance of models drawn from related literature shows that the new proposed task is challenging for the community to solve.",

To answer this question, we design a self-explaining model, LimitedInk, which allows users to extract rationales at any target length. Compared to existing baselines, LimitedInk achieves compatible end-task performance and human-annotated rationale agreement, making it a suitable representation of the recent class of self-explaining models. We use LimitedInk to conduct a user study on the impact of rationale length, where we ask human judges to predict the sentiment label of documents based only on LimitedInk-generated rationales with different lengths.

Among existing work, a popular solution is to use pre-trained language models to score candidate choices directly conditioned on the question or context. However, such scores from language models can be easily affected by irrelevant factors, such as word frequencies, sentence structures, etc. These distracting factors may not only mislead the model to choose a wrong answer but also make it oversensitive to lexical perturbations in candidate answers. In this paper, we present a novel SEmantic-based Question Answering method (SEQA) for unsupervised commonsense question answering. Instead of directly scoring each answer choice, our method first generates a set of plausible answers with generative models (e.g., GPT-2), and then uses these plausible answers to select the correct choice by considering the semantic similarity between each plausible answer and each choice. We devise a simple, yet sound formalism for this idea and verify its effectiveness and robustness with extensive experiments. We evaluate the proposed method on four benchmark datasets, and our method achieves the best results in unsupervised settings. Moreover, when attacked by TextFooler with synonym replacement, SEQA demonstrates much less performance drops than baselines, thereby indicating stronger robustness.",
