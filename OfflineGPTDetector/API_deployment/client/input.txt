The impressive text generation capabilities of the Large-scale Language Model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, have both astonished individuals and motivated researchers to develop detectors to mitigate potential risks such as misinformation, phishing, and academic dishonesty. However, most previous studies (e.g., HC3) have focused on building detectors that distinguish between entirely ChatGPT-generated and human-written text, which are vulnerable to well-crafted strategies such as paraphrasing. To address this limitation, we have created a novel dataset called HPPT (ChatGPT-polished academic abstracts), which consists of pairs of human-written abstracts and ChatGPT-polished versions. This dataset enables the construction of a more robust detector, and we introduce the Polish Ratio method to better measure the involvement of ChatGPT in the generated text by similarity metrics, thereby improving the distinction between ChatGPT-generated and human-written text. Experimental results demonstrate that our model performs well on both the HC3 and HPPT datasets, indicating its robustness. Additionally, the Polish Ratio method we propose offers a more comprehensive explanation by quantifying the degree of ChatGPT involvement. \textbf{[Added conclusion?]}We consider a PR value greater than 0.2 as indicative of ChatGPT involvement and a value greater than 0.6 as suggesting the majority of words are generated by ChatGPT.
Daddy just didn’t know how to show love. It was Mom who held the family together. He just went to work every day and came home; she’d have a list of sins we’d committed and he’d scold us about them.
Dad's love was a silent embrace, hidden beneath his stoic exterior. While he may not have known how to express it openly, his actions spoke volumes. Every day, he tirelessly toiled to provide for our family, ensuring our needs were met and dreams were nurtured. His unwavering dedication was a testament to his love. In his own way, he showered us with care, guidance, and a sense of security. It wasn't always evident, but deep down, his heart overflowed with paternal affection, silently stitching the threads of our lives together.
