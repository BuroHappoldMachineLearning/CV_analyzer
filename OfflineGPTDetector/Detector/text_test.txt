The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI makes people surprised at its strong capability of Language Modeling. Still, it also raises concerns about abuse and necessary methods for accurate detection of ChatGPT-involved texts to prevent risks such as misleading information, phishing, and academic dishonesty. Previous studies have primarily focused on detecting fully generated ChatGPT texts, failing to detect polished texts that have undergone refinement by ChatGPT. In this study, we want to develop a detection system that can make our detection robust. We first construct a dataset called Human-ChatGPT Polished Paired abstracTs (HPPT), which comprises paired abstracts in both polished and original forms, along with similarity measurements indicating the degree of polishing. Moreover, we provide Polish Ratio to denote the degree of modification by ChatGPT, visualization of SHAP and GLTR method to assist the decision to make the detection robust. Experiments demonstrate that our model performs well on both HC3 and HPPT datasets indicating the robustness of our model and our explanation methods also motivate us to discover the patterns of ChatGPT polishing. Our detection methods are capable of identifying both fully ChatGPT-generated texts and ChatGPT-polished texts, effectively defending against potential attacks involving text refinement.
Deodorant is used to help reduce body odor, which is the smell that can come from sweating. When we sweat, bacteria on our skin can break down the sweat and produce a smell. Deodorant contains antimicrobial agents that can kill the bacteria and help reduce body odor. It also often contains fragrances that can help cover up any remaining smell.\n\nWhile it is true that some animals use their natural smells to attract a mate, humans do not typically rely on body odor as a way of attracting a partner. In fact, body odor can be considered unpleasant by some people. Using deodorant can help us feel more clean and fresh, and can help us feel more confident in social situations.
A surname is a family name passed down from one generation to another, while a given name is a personal name given to an individual at birth or at a young age. The given name is also sometimes referred to as a first name or a forename.\n\nIn many cultures, the surname is the last name and is used to identify a person within a family or a larger social group. The given name, on the other hand, is the first name and is usually used to address or refer to a person.\n\nFor example, if a person's full name is "John Smith," "John" is the given name and "Smith" is the surname. In some cultures, the given name is followed by the surname, while in others, the surname comes before the given name.
